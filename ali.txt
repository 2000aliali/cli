The error message you're seeing indicates that Docker is failing to start, with the process exiting with a failure status (status=1/FAILURE). This can happen for a number of reasons, including issues with Docker's configuration or missing dependencies.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve this:
1. Check Docker Logs

First, check the Docker logs to get more detailed information about why it failed. Run:

journalctl -u docker.service -n 50

This will show the last 50 lines of the Docker service logs. Look for specific error messages that can give you more insight into what is going wrong.
2. Check Docker Configuration

The error message shows that Docker is trying to start with the --insecure-registry harbor.local. This could indicate a configuration issue.

    Check the /etc/docker/daemon.json file for any misconfigurations. If the file doesn’t exist, try creating it with default values, or make sure the configuration is correct. For example:

{
  "insecure-registries": ["harbor.local"]
}

Make sure the registry harbor.local is reachable and correctly configured.
3. Check Containerd Status

Docker relies on containerd, so it's essential to check if containerd is running correctly:

sudo systemctl status containerd

If it's not running, try starting it:

sudo systemctl start containerd

Then, check if Docker can start after this.
4. Restart Docker

Try restarting Docker and force a system restart:

sudo systemctl restart docker

If that doesn’t work, try restarting the entire system:

sudo reboot

5. Verify Docker Installation

After restarting, verify the installation:

docker --version

6. Reinstall Docker (if needed)

If Docker continues to fail, you may want to remove it completely and reinstall it.

    Remove Docker and its dependencies:

sudo apt-get purge docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo apt-get autoremove

    Clean up any residual Docker files:

sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
sudo rm -rf /etc/docker

    Reinstall Docker:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io

    Start the Docker service:

sudo systemctl start docker

    Enable Docker to start on boot:

sudo systemctl enable docker

7. Check Firewall or SELinux (if applicable)

If you're running a firewall or SELinux, ensure that they are not blocking Docker:

    For firewalld, allow Docker traffic:

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-masquerade --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

    For SELinux, check if it's in enforcing mode:

sestatus

If SELinux is enabled, you may want to temporarily disable it for troubleshooting:

sudo setenforce 0

After following these steps, check again if Docker is able to start successfully. Let me know if you encounter any specific errors!

ChatGPT said:

It seems that Docker is still failing to start, and the issue persists despite reinstalling Docker multiple times. Since the error message indicates a failure related to the Docker daemon (dockerd), let’s try to dig deeper into the issue.
Next Steps to Troubleshoot
1. Check Detailed Docker Logs

You mentioned using journalctl earlier, but let’s dig deeper into the specific logs. Try:

journalctl -xeu docker.service

This command will give you the extended error logs related to the Docker service. Look for specific error messages or clues about what might be causing the failure.
2. Check if Docker Socket is Available

The error message suggests that Docker is being triggered by docker.socket. It’s important to verify that the Docker socket is properly set up and running:

sudo systemctl status docker.socket

Ensure the socket is active and running.
3. Check for Missing Dependencies

Docker depends on a few services, including containerd. Check if containerd is running:

sudo systemctl status containerd

If it’s not running, try starting it:

sudo systemctl start containerd

Then, attempt to start Docker again:

sudo systemctl start docker

4. Remove Docker Configuration Files

It’s possible that some corrupted Docker configuration files are causing the issue. You should remove any remaining configuration files manually before reinstalling Docker.

sudo rm -rf /etc/docker
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker

After doing this, reinstall Docker again:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io

Then, attempt to start Docker:

sudo systemctl start docker

5. Check for Firewall/Network Issues

Ensure there are no firewall or network issues preventing Docker from starting. If you are behind a proxy, Docker may fail to start if it can't access the internet or registry.

    Check Firewall: If you have ufw or any firewall configured, make sure Docker is allowed to communicate over the network:

sudo ufw allow 2375/tcp

    Proxy Configuration: If you are using a proxy, configure Docker to work with it by editing the Docker systemd unit file:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf

Add the proxy settings:

[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy.com:port/"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=https://your-proxy.com:port/"

Then reload and restart the service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker

6. Check Docker Version

Make sure you have the latest version of Docker installed:

docker --version

You might want to remove Docker and install it from the official Docker repository if it’s not the latest stable version.
7. Try Running Docker in Debug Mode

If the issue persists, try running Docker in debug mode to get more information:

sudo dockerd --debug

This will start Docker in the foreground with debug logging enabled. Check the output for any specific error or issue.

If the issue still persists after trying these steps, please share the specific logs from journalctl -xeu docker.service to help pinpoint the exact cause of the failure.
